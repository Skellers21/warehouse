/**
* Class to provide access to reports generated by the Indicia core.
*
* A report will have a number of parameters that need to be completed by the requester. Because
* this interface is designed to be used by both the core module and the site module, we cannot
* directly request this information. As such, we do the following:
* <ol>
* <li> Grab the report and parse it for parameters. </li>
* <li> Cache the report (if it didn't exist on the server already) and assign it a unique id,
* which we store temporarily in the Kohana cache. </li>
* <li> Send a response back to the requester, inviting them to fill in the parameters. This
* reponse will include the id generated in step 3. </li>
* <li> The requester sends back the requested parameters, which are checked against the cache to
* ensure they're all there. If not, repeat these steps. </li>
* <li> The core retrieves the report from cache, merges the parameters in and executes the query
* against the core database. Results are formatted and returned to the requester. </li>
* </ol>
*
* We should also allow submission of parameters with the report, or a combination of this and
* requesting them as we go.
*
* We use XML reports roughly in keeping with the standard defined in Recorder (though with limited
* complexity compared to recorder's options). However, this module is written to easily allow
* reports written in other formats, and in keeping with the rest of the project we use JSON as our
* principal language for network communication - e.g. for parameter requests, delivery, and other
* messages.
